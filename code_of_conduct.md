The N-Body Shop collaboration strives to provide an inclusive and safe environment for all of its members regardless of race, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, nationality, ethnicity, immigration status, or religion. We welcome people with diverse skills, backgrounds, experiences, and opinions and recognize that such diversity is critical to the realization of our scientific endeavors. We also recognize the important value of mentorship and the obligation of our more senior members to actively support the scientific and career aspirations of our younger members. To encourage the cultivation of such an inclusive and productive environment, we have formulated the following code of conduct to which all members of the collaboration are expected to adhere. When applicable, N-body Shop members are expected to adhere to these guidelines when interacting with the community outside of our collaboration. These instances include, but are not limited to, interactions at conferences, academic talks/seminars/colloquia, and public outreach events.

<ol>
<li>We treat all people with respect, regardless of race, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, nationality, ethnicity, immigration status, or religion. This collaboration will be a bullying- and harassment-free environment. Harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary comments or jokes are not tolerated.<br>

Harassment includes sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, sexual attention or innuendo, deliberate intimidation, stalking, and photography or recording of an individual without consent. It also includes offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race or religion.
</li>
<li>
When transgressions occur, we will provide critical feedback to others in a way that is constructive and respectful. Likewise we will be open to critical feedback, including and especially from those less senior than us. This includes both feedback on science and/or code development, as well as feedback on behavior and/or mentorship.
</li>
<br>
<li>
We welcome the inclusion of diverse opinions and make it our priority that all group members are heard and feel confident in freely expressing their opinions.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Collaboration members who actively mentor students, or plan to in the future, will prioritize mentorship training as a part of their career development.
</li>
<br>
<li>Faculty/PIs are expected to make attendance to conferences such as SACNAS, NSBP, etc. a central priority with the overt goal of reinforcing/establishing pipelines to further the representation of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). The entire collaboration, but especially Faculty/PIs, are expected to openly encourage participation in such conferences as well by BIPOC students/advisees. Funding for such travel will be made a central priority on grant applications.</li>
<br>
<li>Members that supervise students are expected to be clear what they can provide their advisees financially (travel funding, salary, etc). Travel funding for students (particularly to give conference talks/posters; also, see above) should be highly prioritized by Faculty/PI members and included in their grant applications.</li>
<br>
<li>Advisors and/or mentors are expected to regularly check-in with their advisees and openly ask for feedback on their own mentorship performance. Advisors must be open to critique from their students/mentees and strive to outwardly demonstrate this vulnerability. Advisors are expected to support their advisees in academic and departmental matters, acting not only as their confidant but also as their advocate.</li>
<br>
<li>Science is done by humans and we are all affected by events occurring locally, globally, and within our larger academic community. Research group meetings, as well as meetings involving the entire collaboration, must be places where we respect and acknowledge each other’s humanity. This acknowledgement includes (but is not limited to) providing a safe space for discussions outside of strict academic topics related to the group/collaboration’s research goals. This includes, especially, discussions on concerns related to the culture of the group/collaboration.</li>
<br>
<li>We will respect the work of others, both within the collaboration and without, through written acknowledgement and/or appropriate citations within papers. We will accept requests by original authors for such appropriate acknowledgment. When utilizing code written by other group members, they will be consulted with prior to publication and offered appropriate authorship on the paper.</li>
<br>
<li>Code development by collaboration members which is performed on separate git branches will be treated as proprietary. Such code will not be made public in any way nor used by any group member without the explicit consent of the code author, or any proxy which they have explicitly assigned to act on their behalf. Code that is merged with the master branch of private github accounts will be assumed to be openly accessible to the members of the collaboration. Only when code is merged with the master branch of the public repositories will it be considered open for public use. </li>
<br>
<li>We care about cultivating an inclusive culture beyond our collaboration. To this end, we pledge to collectively boycott any conference which does not have a code of conduct explicitly rejecting harassment and bullying of all forms. When attending conferences, senior members in particular are expected to call out behavior which is inappropriate/against that event’s code of conduct through the appropriate channels.</li>
<br>
<li>In order to hold the wider community to adopt better practices, we will publicly call out conferences which either do not have codes of conduct, or fail to adhere to and/or adequately enforce them. This work is in service to normalizing the idea that respect for all people must be a priority for all academic events.</li>
<br>
</ol>

It is crucial that this code of conduct is enforced by members, particularly more senior members, in the N-body Shop collaboration. To this end we have comprised the following resources and guidelines for those that witness - or are actively harmed by - violations of this code of conduct by collaboration members.

<ol>
<li>Any N-body Shop member that witnesses events of bullying, harassment, or any form of aggression toward anyone which is perpetrated by a member of this collaboration should first approach the affected person to show support and check on their wellbeing. The witness may suggest the affected person report the behavior (see below) or offer to do so on their behalf. It is critical to keep in mind that it is up to the affected person alone what actions they feel comfortable taking related to this event.</li>
<br>
<li>As per the rules listed above, all group members are expected to be open to criticism on their behavior. With this in mind, it is encouraged that those directly affected by - or witnesses to (with appropriate permission; see above) - any violation of the code of conduct first attempt to address the offense with the offender directly. However, we recognize that various power dynamics may make such a confrontation harmful to the witness/affected individual. We therefore also provide an anonymous reporting system (???) where the offense can be reported (see below).</li>
<br>
<li>An anonymous reporting system will be made available to all collaboration members and will be administered by a rotating committee of 1 graduate student, 1 postdoc, and 1 faculty member within the collaboration. By default each committee member will receive notice of the reported offense, but the option will be made available to send to a subset of this committee. The committee will then take appropriate action to rectify the situation to the best of their ability, potentially contacting a third party member(s) when required.</li>
</ol>

Consequences for violating the code of conduct.

<ol>
<li>Violators of this code of conduct are expected to openly and graciously receive criticism on their behavior, either from the witness or affected individual, from member(s) of the committee described above, or from an appropriately designated third party member(s) of the collaboration. For such initial offenses, unless otherwise made explicit, it will be assumed that the violating individual was not acting in malice and will be open to constructive criticism on their behavior. In this vein it is expected that the violating individual be approached with both respect and honesty about their actions and their consequences.</li>
<br>
<li>Should the collaboration member continue to violate the code of conduct, a formal condemnation and warning will be given by the committee members.</li>
<br>
<li>If the offense(s) in question, which have resulted in a formal warning, relate to behavior toward a student, the collaboration will insist that the violating individual not continue to interact with any students without another collaboration member of equal seniority directly involved until it has been made clear that the issue has been rectified.</li>
<br>
<li>After the formal warning, should any behavior by said collaboration member continue to go against this code of conduct, the member will be barred from the collaboration. They will lose access to any proprietary code and will no longer be offered authorship on collaboration papers. The offending party will also no longer be welcome in collaboration meetings and/or conferences and will be removed from all relevant email lists.</li>
</ol>
